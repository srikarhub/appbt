Before we start, it's important to understand how dedicated we are at buzztouch.com to help
you with your mobile endeavors. Everyday we hear from aspiring and seasoned developers
about how much they appreciate our effort. This software package encompasses our latest
body of work and we are very excited about it's future and appreciate it's many thousands of users.

The Buzztouch development method revolves around Plugins. Breaking down the 
development process into smaller, easier to manage parts is best for everyone. 
The primary purpose of the software is to help you create, 
organize, update, and distribute mobile software. Most of this effort will 
revolve around you getting familiar with how Buzztouch plugins work, how they 
are installed, and how they can be created or extended. Make it a point to learn 
how to make a very simple plugin (start by copying an existing plugin) and you'll 
be well on your way to a much higher level of efficiency.

There are three main parts to any mobile application (#3 is not always necessary).

1) 	CORE: The application itself, in Buzztouch speak this is the "Buzztouch core" and 
	includes thousands of lines of well tested code related to how an 
	app launches and behaves. Consider this core code the "engine" for every app. 
	Compiling this core-code in Xcode or Eclipse before adding any plugins will 
	produce an error free application that's ready to be customized.

2) 	PLUGINS: Individual screens and features found inside the applicaiton. Plugins
	work with the Buzztouch core to extend features and functionality. 
	An Image Gallery is a plugin. A button menu is a plugin. Everything you see on the
	screen on your device is a plugin. Some plugins are extremely
	simple, others quite complex. Creating new plugins or extending existing 
	plugins is much more manageable than starting from scratch.

3)  BACKEND: The control panel at buzztouch.com supports tens of
	thousands of apps. This is OK for some, not for all. Some developers need finer conrol over their apps 
	backend and	associated content. Self hosting Buzztouch (this software) is a natural solution that
	supports that idea. This open source software is a great choice for developers, creatives,
	and organizations that want or need this fine control.
