Change Log: Buzztouch 3.0
November 26, 2013
David Book, buzztouch.com

	Updates:

--	Improved project download screen. Project download screen now allows app owners to select which version
	of the Buzztouch Core (iOS or Android) to use as the basis for the download. v2.0 or v3.0
	
--	Major changes and newly introduced files to support new plugin package architechture. 

	bt_screens.php, bt_screen.php,	bt_childItem.php, bt_JSON_API_AJAX.php, bt_screen_json.php, app_screens.js, app_screen.js
	
	/BT-server/bt_v15/bt_app/bt_screens.php	
		This is the master list of screens for an app. This screen has been updated and now allows
		an app owner to quickly and easily adjust the "raw" JSON data for any screen. New arbitrary
		values can be added / introduced regardless of how the plugin landing page is configured. 
				
	/BT-server/bt_v15/bt_app/bt_screen.php 	
		This new file serves as the landing page for all plugins. Plugin packages no longer use 
		an index.php page. screen.php page is used instead.

	/BT-server/bt_v15/bt_app/bt_childItem.php 	
		This new file serves as the pop-up page when working with a child item. This is different than
		modifying a childItem's JSON using the "raw" pop-up. This bt_childItem.php page is used by 
		plugin developers to show individual form elements making it easier for an app owner to understand.
	
	/BT-server/bt_v15/bt_app/bt_JSON_API_AJAX.php 
		This new file is used to save screen data. Plugin developers use javascript functions in app_screen.js
		to interact with the API methods in the bt_JSON_API_AJAX.php file. 
	
	/BT-server/bt_v15/bt_app/bt_screen_json.php
		This new file is used as the "pop up window" when working with raw JSON data from screens.php
		
	/BT-server/bt_v15/bt_scripts/app_screens.js
		This new file is the javscript file used in conjuction with screens.php
		
	/BT-server/bt_v15/bt_scripts/app_screen.js
		This new file is the javscript file used in conjuction with screens.php. It includes javascript
		routines used by plugin developers to make modifications to backend data related to each screen. It
		works in conjunction with bt_JSON_API_AJAX.php.
		
--	Picker Screens. bt_pickerColor.php, bt_pickerScreen.php, bt_pickerMenu.php, bt_pickerFile.php
	These screens have been updated and simplified. Plugin developers no longer link to these files
	directly using an anchor tag. Instead, javscript functions are called to open each picker screen. 
	Javscript routines are named: fnPickColor(), fnPickScreen(), fnPickMenu(), fnPickFile() and each
	takes some arguments. See /BT-server/bt_v15/bt_scripts/app_screen.js for a detailed list. 
	
-- 	Plugin Sections: The /BT-server/bt_v15/bt_includes folder contains many new .html files. Each of these
	files is used by screen.php to manipulate common properties when working with screen in a control
	panel. Example: bt_section_bacgkroundColor.html, bt_section_tabBar.html, bt_section_dataURL.html
	Plugin developers can use these include files in their plugin packages or create their own. 
	
--	Plugin upload process: The plugin upload process is handled by Admin > pluginsUpdate.php and 
	pluginsUpdates_AJAX.php. The upload process will no longer allow .php files (no .php files) in the
	uploaded package. If a .php file is necessary, control panel owners can include it in the package, 
	upload the package using FTP, then run the "refresh plugins" routine. If an index.php page is found
	it will be used as the landing page for that plugin. Else, the standard landing screen will be used. 
	
--	class.Plugin.php: The /BT-server/includes/class.Plugin.php file was modified to account for some changes in the fnCheckPluginContents() and
	fnGetPluginInfo() routines. 
	
--	Install / Update process: /BT-server/install/db.php was modified to add or alter the plugins table. A
	new column was introduced - landingPage. The landingPage colum holds one of three values. blank (empty string
	or null), bt_screen.php or index.php. The landing page for a plugin is determined by the value of this field. 
	
		landingPage column value: "bt_screen.php" is the standard value and the "new approach." When the 
		"refresh plugin" routine is	used this value will be set to "bt_screen.php." If NO index.php page is 
		included in a plugin package package. If an	index.php page is included it will be set to "index.php." 
		If it is null, or an empty string, the bt_screen.php file will be used as the plugins landing page. 
		This column and logic was introduced to allow for some flexibility and some backwards compatibility. 
		
		  
		
	


Change Log: Buzztouch 2.1.9
August 25, 2013
David Book, buzztouch.com

	Updates:

--	Improved project download screen. Project download screen now allows app owners to select which plugins
	to include in the download and which parnter SDK instructions to include. 

-- 	Added Menus screen to allow app owners to create menus. Menus are a new JSON items that appear in the
	BT_config.txt file and are used when selecting a Context Menu for a screen in the control panel. 

--	Added support for "check all plugins for updates" so admins don't need to click each plugin
	individually, one by one in order to check for updates. 

--	Updated bt_pickerMenu.php and bt_pickerScreen.php to accomodate for apostrophe's in nicknames. These picker
	dialogues where failing if a user "selected" a screen using the picker. 
	
--	Fixed index.php page in the /root of the install. This is the login page. This script
	re-directs logged in users to the /account directory after successfully logging in. The
	re-direct URL included a rogue / (backslash) character that was causing issues. Fixed.

-- 	Improved bt_pickerScreen.php. This is the pop-up window used to select a screen to load
	using the "select" options in lots of places in the control panel. It was super slow!
	
--	Re-named all the .js files in the /bt_v15/ bt_scripts folder






Change Log: Buzztouch 2.1.8
February 06, 2013
David Book, buzztouch.com

	Updates:

--	The config table in the database is no longer used. The config.txt file in the root
	of the project holds all configuration settings. This makes it easier for users
	to understand what their changing. 
	
-- 	The database has two additional tables. bt_apn_devicesa and bt_apn_queue, these are necessary
	to support Push Notifications. 
	
--	Application control panels now include a Usage Map and a download data screen. In most cases
	a Google Maps API Key will be required to power the map. 
	
--	Application control have two new screens to manage Push Notifications and Registered Devices.

--	Application control panels have a new screen for Live / Design mode. Compiling apps in 
	Design mode allows app owners to make changes to their configuration data without affecting
	apps that are already published. 

--	Application Theme: When you click "Theme" in an application control panel, you'll be taken
	to the current active theme and not the list of themes. In most cases only one theme is used
	anyway and this saves a few clicks.
	
--	The plugin management process (admin control panel) is greatly improved. You can now download
	and install and update plugins with a few clicks. You can also import plugins from your
	buzztouch.com control panel.
